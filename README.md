# Prolog

A collaborative learning project between a human and Claude (an LLM).

Two intertwined goals:

1. **Learn Prolog.** The human is picking up logic programming from scratch, with Claude as a pairing partner.

2. **Explore the parallels between logic programming and LLMs.** Prolog is declarative — you describe what's true and ask queries. The runtime searches for consistent answers. This is conceptually close to what an LLM does: pattern matching over learned structure, searching for completions that are consistent with the prompt. Working in Prolog makes that connection tangible rather than metaphorical.

The hope is that writing logic programs sharpens intuition for both — how Prolog thinks, and how Claude does.
